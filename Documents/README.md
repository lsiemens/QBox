## QBox Road Map ##

### Version 1.0.0: Production ###
#### Unity ####
- [ ] Add an _About_ page in the menu. It should contain name, version, descriptions, author and links
- [ ] Add a resolution selector to the Options menu. It will likely be necessary to disable some potentials at low resolution
- [ ] Add low frame rate dialoge to sugest lowering settings. It should apper at most once per session
- [ ] Improve the Options page in the menu
- [ ] Document Unity code
- [ ] Reorganize and simplify Unity code
- [ ] Fix quantum data and display in the PC version

#### Web and Documentation ####
- [ ] Make a github-pages website. It should have download links, links to the repository and a description of the mathematical methods
- [ ] A post on lsiemens.com about QBox, and integration with qbox.lsiemens.com
- [ ] A latex document describing the mathematical methods, physics theory and algorithms in QBox

#### Other ####
- [ ] Disable sleep in simulation mode

### Version ~ 2.0.0: Near Future ###
- [ ] Momentum space repersentation of wave functions and wave function evolution
- [ ] Measurements of expected position and momentum ...
- [ ] Better color maps
- [ ] Distribution on more platforms

### Version >> 2.0.0: Far Future ###
- [ ] Add pertubation theory and time dependent hamiltonian (multiple potentials using projection to switch between)
- [ ] 2 particle wave functions in 1D (Add a symmetry/antisymmetry condition to the solver and analisis tools for multiparticle wave functions)
- [ ] Energy level diagrams to track, photon emmision/absorption, forbiden transitions and energy level splitting
