# QBox: User Guide

Welcome to the user documentation for QBox, simulation software for solving Schrodinger's equation in two dimensions in real time. In this documentation I will assume you are familiar with standard concepts and terminology in quantum mechanics, for a brief introduction to the quantum mechanics used in QBox and for further reading see [Here (Coming soon)].

## What is QBox
As stated above QBox solves Schrodinger's equation in two dimensions. In particular this software is based on the eigenvalue problem formulation of Schrodinger's equation. The energy eigenvalues and eigenstates have been precomputed for fixed set of potentials which are then used to solve for the time evolution of arbitrary initial states defined by the user. In this app for each of the included potentials, the user is able to view the energy eigenstates, construct the initial wave function and simulate the time evolution of said initial state.
