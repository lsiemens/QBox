QBox solves Schrödinger's equation in two dimensions. In particular this
software is based on the eigenvalue problem formulation of Schrödinger's
equation. The energy eigenvalues and eigenstates have been precomputed
for a fixed set of potentials which are then used to solve for the time
evolution of arbitrary initial states defined by the user. In this app
for each of the included potentials, the user is able to view the energy
eigenstates, construct the initial wave function and simulate the time
evolution of said initial state.
