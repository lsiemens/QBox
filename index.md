QBox visualizes the time evolution of an electronâ€™s wave function for
various problems (Quantum Potentials). There are multiple tools for
constructing the initial wave function to be simulated, making it
possible to explore how an electron behaves in a given problem. In
addition to simulating the wave function evolution, the steady state
solutions to each potential can be explored. Using this app it is
possible with the included problems to investigate some quantum mechanical
phenomena including: Quantum interference, Quantum tunnelling and
diffraction of particles.

Features:
- multiple problems to choose from
- view steady state solutions
- simulate time evolution of wave function
- cross platform support (Android, Linux and Windows) 

Problems/Potentials:
- particle in a box
- free space
- harmonic potential
- more
