Qbox visualizes the time evolution of an electron’s wave function for various
problems (Potentials). There are multiple tools for constructing the initial
wave function to be simulated, making it possible to explore how an electron
behaves in a given problem. In addition to simulating the wave function
evolution, the steady state solutions to each potential can be explored. Using
this app it is possible with the included problems to investigate some quantum
mechanical phenomena including: Quantum interference, Quantum tunneling and
diffraction of particles.

The time evolution of the wave function is solved by applying the separation of
variables method to the time dependent Schrödinger equation. Using separation of
variables has the advantage that it provides a reasonable method for hardware
acceleration, making it possible to solve the 2D time dependent Schrödinger
equation as a real time simulation.

Features:
- multiple problems to choose from
- view steady state solutions
- simulate time evolution of wave function

Problems/Potentials:
- particle in a box
- free space
- harmonic potential
- hydrogen atomic orbitals in 2D
- hydrogen molecular ion in 2D
- more
